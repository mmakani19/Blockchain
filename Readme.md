# Blocchain-Proof of Authority

## Project Adamnet

### 1. Created Node01 and Node02 and generated addresses using geth 
### 2. Ran Puppeth and network name adamnet was gnerated with new genesis block 
### 3. Proof of Auhority consensus algorithm was selected
### 4. Both the Nodes addresses were sealed and pre-funded with no option
### 5. Existing genesis was managed
### 6. adamnet.json file was exported to Blockchain-Tools folder and another file generated adamnet-harmony.json was deleted 
### 7. Node01 and Node02 was initialized using adamnet.json with geth
### 8. Ran Node01 for mining and mycrypto account was unlocked using keystore and password
### 9. Ran Node02 for mining using a different port ennode from Node01 and was unlocked
### 10.Node01 and Node02 were running for mining and started looking for peers. 
### 11.Custom netwrork node was created in MyCrypto
### 12.MyCrypto was funded with default ETH amount 
### 13.Transaction was run to transfer 1 ETH from Node01 address to Node02 address
### 14.Transaction hash was was run to transfer 1 ETH from Node01 address to Node02 address

### Note: The Node01 and Node02 mining contunued for hours looking for peers so transaction hash could not be confirmed after several attempts
